This is your JSON deployment file! It contains all the information for each stage you intend to deploy to. Its neat.

To add more stages, simple copy/paste the following and add it to the object, changing the data as needed.
All of the fields are required.

You can, however, leave linkedFiles and linkedDirs as an empty array if you don't like to symlink things.

"stage_name": {
	"host": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
	"username": "you",
    "privatePath": "/path/to/your/private/project",
    "publicPath": "/path/to/your/public/project",
	"branch": "master"
}
